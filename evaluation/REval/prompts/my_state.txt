You are given a Python function and a question about its execution behavior.
Your task is to simulate the code execution and answer in the format: value; type
If the specified line is not executed, answer with: Nil

There may be multiple possible answers, but you should output only one.

Following the examples:
Example one:
[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
    ans = a + b
    if ans > 0:
        ans = int(a)
    else:
        ans = b
    return ans

f(1.1, 2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 4 (        ans = int(a)) executed when f(1.1, 2) is called? If so, what is the value and type of the variable ans after Line 4 is executed? 
If the code statement is not executed, answer Nil.
[/QUESTION]
[ANSWER]
1; int
[/ANSWER]

Example two:
[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
    ans = a + b
    if ans > 0:
        ans = int(a)
    else:
        ans = b
    return ans

f(1.1, -2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 4 (        ans = int(a)) executed when f(1.1, -2) is called? If so, what is the value and type of the variable ans after Line 4 is executed?
If the code statement is not executed, answer Nil.
[/QUESTION]
[ANSWER]
Nil
[/ANSWER]

Example three:
[PYTHON]
class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = []
    
    def f(self, y):
        self.x.append(y)
        return y

a = A()
assertEqual(a.f('a'), 'a')
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Is Line 6 (        self.x.append(y)) executed when the above test code is called? If so, what is the value and type of the variable self.x after Line 6 is executed?
If the code statement is not executed, answer Nil.
[/QUESTION]
[ANSWER]
['a']; list
[/ANSWER]

Now simulate the code execution and answer the question below.
[PYTHON]
{code}
{invocation}
[/PYTHON]

[QUESTION]
Is Line {line} ({codeline}) executed when {invocation_abbr} is called? If so, what is the value and type of the variable {var} after Line {line} is executed?
If the code statement is not executed, answer Nil.
[/QUESTION]
