You are a Python execution tracer. You will be given a function, an invocation, and a target line of code. Your goal is to determine the next line to be executed.

Analyze the provided Python code and its invocation to answer the question.

Example:
[PYTHON]
def f(a, b):
  ans = a + b
  if ans > 0:
      ans = int(a)
  else:
      ans = b
  return ans

f(1.1, 2)
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
Tracing the call f(1.1, 2), what line is executed immediately after ans = int(a)?
[/QUESTION]

Correct Response:
<reasoning>
1. The function `f` is called with `a=1.1` and `b=2`.
2. `ans` is calculated as `1.1 + 2`, which is `3.1`.
3. The condition `ans > 0` (i.e., `3.1 > 0`) is true.
4. Execution enters the `if` block.
5. The target line `ans = int(a)` is executed.
6. After the `if` block completes, execution proceeds to the next statement outside the `if/else` structure.
7. The next line is `return ans`.
</reasoning>
<answer>
return ans
</answer>

Your Task:
[PYTHON]
{code}
{invocation}
[/PYTHON]
[QUESTION]
During the execution of {invocation_abbr}, what line of code is executed immediately after {codeline}?
[/QUESTION]

Rules:

1. If {codeline} is never reached during the execution, the answer is -1.

2. If the function terminates immediately after {codeline} (e.g., it is a return statement or the final line), the answer is -1.

3. Otherwise, the answer is the verbatim source code of the next line. Do not use line numbers.


Format your response strictly as follows, with no other text:
<reasoning>
Your step-by-step reasoning for the execution flow.
</reasoning>
<answer>
The raw code statement or -1.
