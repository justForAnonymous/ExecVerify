You are given a Python function and test code that includes input(s) to the function.
Your task is to complete the assertions in the test code with the expected output values.
Try to execute the code, even if the function is incorrect or incomplete.

Follow the style shown in the examples below.


Example one:
[PYTHON]
def g(s):
    return s + "a"

assert g("x9j") == ??
[/PYTHON]
[ANSWER]
assert g("x9j") == "x9ja"
[/ANSWER]

Example two:
[PYTHON]
class A:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x

    def f(self, y):
        return self.x + y

# Test code starts here. Only write the completed test code in your answer.
a = A(3)
assertEqual(a.f(2), ??)
assertEqual(a.f(4), ??)
[/PYTHON]
[ANSWER]
a = A(3)
assertEqual(a.f(2), 5)
assertEqual(a.f(4), 7)
[/ANSWER]

Now complete the following assertions:
[PYTHON]
{code}
{invocation}
[/PYTHON]

Format your response strictly as follows:
<reasoning>your step-by-step reasoning here</reasoning>
<answer>the complete assertion statements</answer>
